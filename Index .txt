     This chapter will cover the following important @ rules:
 The @import: rule imports another style sheet into the current style 
sheet.
 The @charset rule indicates the character set the style sheet uses.
 The @font-face rule is used to exhaustively describe a font face for use in 
a document.
 The !important rule indicates that a user-defined rule should take 
precedence over the author's style sheets.
NOTE: There are other @ rules which we will cover in subsequent chapters.
The @import Rule
The @import rule allows you to import styles from another style sheet. It should 
appear right at the start of the style sheet before any of the rules, and its value 
is a URL.
It can be written in one of the two following ways:
<style tyle="text/css">
<!--
@import "mystyle.css";
or
@import url("mystyle.css");
.......other CSS rules .....
-->
</style>
The significance of the @import rule is that it allows you to develop your style 
sheets with a modular approach. You can create various style sheets and then 
include them wherever you need them.
